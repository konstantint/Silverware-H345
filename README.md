### JJRC H345 Alternate Firmware

This is an experimental fork of the Silverware-E011 project, adapted (in a maximally hackish manner in a couple of evenings of trial and error) to work with the JJRC H345 toy quadcopter.

As JJRC H345 uses a completely different chip, the updated code is not "backward compatible" with the original project, nor are the flashing instructions relevant (you need a NuLink programmer to perform those). Perhaps I'll eventually find time to document things.

The factory firmware of JJRC H345 is not available (as it seems the chip is security-locked to prevent reading it).

For information about the original Silverware project, check out the [source E011 branch](https://github.com/silver13/Eachine-E011), the [Silverware Wiki](http://sirdomsen.diskstation.me/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=start) and the [corresponding RCGroups thread](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2512604-Eachine-H8-mini-acro-firmware).
